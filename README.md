# AWSProject
Making a realtime project to get up running with AWS services.


Overview

Deploying web application over cloud with the help of 3 tier architecture can be a tedious task if one is not well versed with basic cloud services like EC2, S3, Route 53, IAM, ELB, ASG etc. Even if someone is hands-on with these services there is no guarantee that one will be able to structure the VPC so as to stand upto the 5 pillars of Amazon Web Services.

This Project gives a proper implementation of 3 tier architecture with the justification of each step taken towards configuring the cloud services and knitting them together such that no valnerability is left and the outcome is highly secure, scalable and cost effective.
